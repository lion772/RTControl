# RTControl
An app about scanning QR codes, using MVVM architecture, databinding, room, retrofit and much more. That's an app dedicated to one friend of mine, who works in a steel factory, and I'm willing to help him receive his year award: "Steel Man Of The Year" . Here I have implemented firebase in conjunction with courotine, to be able to store in the backend and retrieve all users and QR codes of the company documents. The main idea is to get rid of all papers and to do away with an old habit.
